# Harry Potterâ€™s invisibility cloak
 Now You See Me, Now You Don't! ðŸŽ€âœ¨  Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into OpenCV, and what better way to explore it than by recreating a little magic? Inspired by Harry Potterâ€™s invisibility cloak, this fun experiment makes anything blue vanish in real-time! âš¡ðŸ‘€  With color detection and background replacement, the camera seamlessly swaps out blue regions with the captured backgroundâ€”giving the illusion of invisibility. No spells required, just some clever image processing! ðŸª„
